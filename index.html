                <h6>
                       My interest in technology has exponential grown over the last couple of years. The fascination for technology started in year 4 when I got my first laptop. The idea of turning any thought into a tangible program is one reason I wanted to do IT. My interest in programming started in year 12 however at that time, I wanted to become a chiropractor but after getting a job as a receptionist at a chiropractic clinic and seeing the effects of COVID was the main reason why I wanted to change courses. 
                       <br>
                       The main reason why I decided to study at RMIT was because I was studying the Bachelor of Health Science/Bachelor of Applied Science (Chiropractic) before I switched over. Another reason is that RMIT is well know for their computer science and related fields.

            <div id = "ovtext">My project for Introduction into information technology is going to be developing a productivity software. It will mainly be focused on project managing and making note taking in a collaborative real-time editor. This will also include the software allowing individuals or groups of people to create notes and coordinate deadlines, objectives and assignments for projects or events in the most efficient and effective way to increase productivity. The project will be a desktop application but will be built with the ability to move to a web-based application and also the capacity to move to mobile. </div>
            <div id = "motivation"><u>My Motivation</u></div>
            <div id = "motivationtext">There are a couple of reasons for why I chosen a productivity software project. One reason is that if I want to continue developing the application after the, I will be entering a growing market. The productivity software market is USD $50 billion (AUD $66.551 billion) with the expectation to grow 14% per year up to 2030. This market is dominated by Microsoft OneNote and Notion. Nearly everyone that is either in school/university or in a company uses one of these two companies to help with productivity. Another reason would be that it will improve my overall programming. It will give me knowledge of both front-end and back-end development that goes into building the infrastructure behind desktop applications. The main motivation why I want to do this project is to help with my time management for university.</div>
            <div id = "Description"><u>Description</u></div>
            <div id = "Desctext">The main features for my productivity software needs are the ability to create, edit and delete notes, objectives and events/deadline. It will be a minimalistic design with easy on the eyes colour pallet templates with the ability to change if to whatever the user feels like. It will have a side bar on the right side which will allow users to edit profile, quick find their notes, access settings, add pages, create templates and to recover deleted pages. This means the user or group of users will be able to navigate the application easterly because all the main functions will always be accessible. <br>The side bar will only cover 15% of the desktop application. The other 85% will be the main project managing and note taking interface. <br>There will be a home page where all the main pages will be located. Pages are folders where you keep all of your notes and deadlines separate from the rest of the notes. This means that you can have multiple pages what contain all different notes and deadlines without create a mess or mixing different notes, such as keeping an individual page for a morning routine and a to-do-list separate. The ability to separate the users notes creates a clean workspace. <br>These are showed as in a list formation and can be assigned a colour or an emoji for extra management. When clicked, it has the page title at the top and an area underneath to create all the notes. There will be an area to add properties that are featured on the page which can be navigated to easterly (such as a checkbox list that is hidden in a large file can be teleported to from the top of the document). Underneath that, there will be an area for adding notes that is similar to Microsoft Word or adding sticky notes. The reason why it would look similar to Word because nearly everyone that has had a computer has used Word which means that there is a solid foundation and understanding of how it will work. There would be features that are similar to Word such as changing the texts colour, changing font size, creating tables, adding pictures and the ability to export to different file types (such as word and pdf). Later, I want to add the feature that you would be able to create a link and be able to send it to other people. <br>Other features I want to add in the future are import features (from word, pdf, etc) and API features to allow for databases and wikis to be added. I also want to add the ability to monetize through adding an enterprise version. This can be added by limiting the free version and adding subscription services which the more the customer pays, the more they can access. These means that the target audience would busy individuals and companies would need to pay for the services who would need to share a lot of files and other documents. </div>
            <div id = "ToolsTech"><u>Tools & Technolgies</u></div>
            <div id = "TTText">For my productivity software project, I will need to utilise programming languages and IDEs, either drawing software or paper and a prototyping tool. The drawing hard copy or software and the prototyping software will be used to design and create a prototype version of the productivity software. I will most likely use either Figma, Webflow or Adobe XD to use as the prototyping tool. These are some of the market leaders and will me some experience using them. For the programming languages, I will be using a mix of Java and python for back-end development of JavaScript (Electron) for front-end development. The IDE I will be using for this project is Visual Studio Code. </div>
            <div id = "SkillsNeeded"><u>Skills Needed</u></div>
            <div id = "SkillsText">The skills I will need for the productivity software project would be graphic design and software development. The graphic design is needed to be able to draw up a rough draft and then create that in a prototyping tool to test and perfect the aesthetic of the program while still making it functional. This will be moving, rearranging certain icons and testing the colour panel. The software development is needed to be able to create the aesthetic and all the infrastructure of the program. Both skills require a lot of trail and error to nail down on the perfect design and functionality.</div>
            <div id = "ifsucc"><u>Outcome</u></div>
            <div id = "ifsucctext">If the productivity software project is successful, I’m hoping the outcome will that I will have an intangible product that I could take to market if I want to.  The original problem will be solved by producing the best software to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. I’m hoping if the product goes live, that this helps people and or companies with managing their projects and deadlines. If it doesn’t go live and the only person that can you it, it will help me at the least with my time management for university and will be a good project to on my future resume for employment.</div>
